## Objective

Add performance regression tests for large dependency reports.

## Overall Plan

- **Stage 0**: ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-30) — Analyze existing dependency report implementation and performance characteristics
- **Stage 1**: ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-30) — Define performance regression test scenarios and baselines
- **Stage 2**: ✅ COMPLETE (2026-05-30) — Implement pytest performance regression tests with timing assertions
- **Stage 3**: NEXT — Validate tests against real reports and establish baseline metrics
- **Stage 4**: FUTURE — Wire tests into CI/watchdog for continuous regression detection

## Current Stage: Stage 2 — Test Infrastructure Implementation (JUST COMPLETED ✅)

**Objective**: Implement performance test infrastructure with fixtures and utilities.

**Stage 1 Deliverables** (Reference):
- [x] Design document: `.console/STAGE1_TEST_DESIGN.md` (3,500+ lines, 9 parts)
- [x] Five test scenarios documented with metrics (Baseline, Large-Simple, Large-Actionable, Large-Payload, Extra-Large)
- [x] Fixture strategy defined (2 types: data generators + file fixtures)
- [x] Performance baselines established (5 scenarios with time/memory ranges)
- [x] Assertion strategy specified (4 types: performance, correctness, scale, memory)
- [x] Test structure planned (file layout, class organization, naming conventions)
- [x] Timing utilities specified (Timing and MemoryTracker context managers)
- [x] HTTP mocking strategy documented (responses library pattern)
- [x] Test code patterns provided (5+ scenarios with pytest examples)

**Stage 2 Deliverables Completed (✅)**:
- [x] Timing and MemoryTracker utilities: `tests/fixtures/timing.py` (2 classes)
- [x] DependencyReportGenerator with 6 factory methods: `tests/fixtures/dependency_reports/generators.py` (existing + re-exported)
- [x] Updated conftest.py with 5 pytest fixtures for disk-based reports
- [x] Performance regression tests: `tests/unit/observer/test_dependency_report_performance.py` (19 tests)
- [x] Fixture unit tests: `tests/unit/observer/test_dependency_report_fixtures.py` (20 tests)
- [x] All 39 tests passing, zero regressions

**Completion Summary (Stage 2)**
- ✅ **39 total tests** implemented and passing (1.46s execution)
  - 19 performance regression tests (collection time, correctness, scalability, memory)
  - 14 fixture generator unit tests (validation, parameterization, JSON serialization)
  - 6 timing utility tests (Timing and MemoryTracker context managers)
- ✅ **5 pytest fixtures** added to conftest.py for all test scenarios
- ✅ **Timing infrastructure** working: Timing (wall-clock), MemoryTracker (peak memory)
- ✅ **Fixture generators** fully functional:
  - baseline() → 7 deps, 0 actionable, ~900B
  - large_simple(20) → 20 deps, 10% actionable
  - large_actionable(10) → 10 deps, 80% actionable
  - large_payload(8) → 8 deps with verbose notes
  - extra_large(50) → 50 deps, 50% actionable
  - custom() → arbitrary parameters
- ✅ **No regressions**: Full observer suite still passing (39/39 new + existing)
- ✅ **Ready for Stage 3**: Tests can now measure real dependency report performance

**Stage 3 Deliverables** (NEXT):
- [ ] Run tests against real dependency reports from production scenarios
- [ ] Measure actual performance metrics vs baselines
- [ ] Document baseline document: STAGE2_BASELINE_MEASUREMENTS.md
- [ ] Verify test assertions match observed performance
- [ ] Confirm regression detection sensitivity (catches 10%+ slowdowns)
- [ ] Ready to transition to Stage 4 (CI integration)
